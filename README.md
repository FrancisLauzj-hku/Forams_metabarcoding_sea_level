Francis Liu Zhaojia, Nicole S. Khan, Howard K.Y. Yu, Arthur Chung, Magali Schweizer, Celia Schunter, 2025. Foraminiferal eDNA reveals late Holocene sea-level changes.

The relevant code for Bayesian transfer function (BTF) analysis was originated and/or modified from Cahill, N., Kemp, A. C., Horton, B. P., & Parnell, A. C. (2016). "A Bayesian hierarchical model for reconstructing relative sea level: from raw data to rates of change." Climate of the Past, 12, 525â€“542. We are grateful to Professor Cahill for her valuable insights regarding the implementation of BTF.
